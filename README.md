## 3cket - Code challenge

The goal of this challenge is to assess the way you think and solve this kind of problems.

The `exercise.php`, a PHP script, is returning a json string as response for when a request is made. It uses the `seeds.csv` to fetch events information (event name, location, latitude and longitude).

What we expect from you is to refactor that script, by:

* Removing mistakes and any bad practices you find
* Adding structure to the project (folder, files)
* Architecture of the code and applicability of design patterns
* Bonus point for having Unit tests (phpunit)
* Knowledge of git
* You must use OOP
* You should introduce some framework-like features like routing, dispatching, autoloading.

The design of this code is more important than it’s function. Focus on good, clean architecture!

Follow programming principles! If you don’t know what that is, search SOLID in object oriented design.

If you have any question, don't hesitate in contact us.
